# Reliability scores

## Resistance against failure
The vehicle is subjected to loads of different kinds. After these loads, the initial performance parameters are re-measured. If the vehicle still has the same parameters, the score for the resistance against failure will be high. These loads are applied:
* Impacts on the falling vehicle, lights, reflectors, brake system and fenders
* Forces and vibrations on the vehicle as a whole with as points of action: contact points between wheels and ground, pedals, seat, grips and luggage carriers.
* UV on saddle, transparent screens and colors
* salt and dust on the vehicle as a whole
* water and freezing cold on the vehicle as a whole
* foolish operations concerning gears, chargers, batteries, kickstand, adjustable parts, cables and wires
* rubbing of labels, electric switches and covers
* cutting of the saddle, hand grips and tyres
* puncturing of the tyres

## Redundancy
Redundancy is the possibility to have a (temporary) solution when a component fails, so that the journey can continued. E.g.; a flat tyre can be repaired, or when one brake fails, another brake is still functional.
The redundancy is examinated on
* lighting, tyres and brakes
* chain and gears
* battery.

## Predictability
A predictable vehicle will warn when a fail is going to happen. E.g.; a brittle fracture in the frame causes a sudden fall, while a ductile fracture in the same area often gives the time to brake and soften the consequences.
The predictability is examined on
* the frame and the handlebars
* the pedal mechanism
* the electric motor and the battery.

## Maintenance
The maintenance score compares the vehicle with an theoretical vehicle that needs maintenance every week, is very hard to maintain and has no standardized components. A high figure means easy to maintain. Following concepts are regarded
* the tyres and attachment of components
* lubrication and regulation of brakes and gears
* electric circuits
