      <h1>Safety score</h1>

      <h2>Visibility</h2>

      <p>A high figure for this parameter indicates that the installed lights are bright, shine as well to the sides as to the front, will rarely be covered by luggage or clothes and complies with the ISO 6742 norm.</p>

      <h2>Road lighting</h2>

      <p>A high figure shows that 5m before the vehicle the street is well illuminated.</p>

      <h2>Brakes</h2>

      <p>The brake score consists mostly of the brake coefficient, which is defined as the brake force at the wheels over the effectuated hand squeeze force. In other words: it's the efficiency of the brake compared to the force of the hand.
      The score can be lowered if:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The redundancy of the brakes is not assured</li>
        <li>The braking force can only be applied during a short period</li>
        <li>Rain influences strongly the braking action</li>
        <li>The weight of the vehicle can lower the brake coefficient below 1</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Tyres</h2>

      <p>The tyres get a good score if he gets a high friction coefficient and puncture resistance.</p>

      <h2>Protection in case of collision</h2>

      <p>The extend in which the vehicle protects the driver in case of a collision and the (possible subsequent) fall.</p>

      <h2>Protection of passengers</h2>

      <p>The extend in which the vehicle protects the passenger in case of a collision and the (possible subsequent) fall.</p>

      <h2>Bell</h2>

      <p>Loudness of the bell. A high score is a bell that sounds loud, but not to loud (avoiding the risk on hearing loss).</p>
