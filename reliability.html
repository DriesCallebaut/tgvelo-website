      <h1>Reliability scores</h1>

      <h2>Resistance against failure</h2>

      <p>The vehicle is subjected to loads of different kinds. After these loads, the initial performance parameters are re-measured. If the vehicle still has the same parameters, the score for the resistance against failure will be high. These loads are applied:</p>

      <ul>
      <li>Impacts on the falling vehicle, lights, reflectors, brake system and fenders</li>
      <li>Forces and vibrations on the vehicle as a whole with as points of action: contact points between wheels and ground, pedals, seat, grips and luggage carriers.</li>
      <li>UV on saddle, transparent screens and colours</li>
      <li>Salt and dust on the vehicle as a whole</li>
      <li>Water and freezing cold on the vehicle as a whole</li>
      <li>Foolish operations concerning gears, chargers, batteries, kickstand, adjustable parts, cables and wires</li>
      <li>Rubbing of labels, electric switches and covers</li>
      <li>Cutting of the saddle, hand grips and tyres</li>
      <li>Puncturing of the tyres</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Redundancy</h2>

      <p>Redundancy is the possibility to have a (temporary) solution when a component fails, so that the journey can continued. E.g.; a flat tyre can be repaired, or when one brake fails, another brake is still functional.
      The redundancy is examinated on</p>

      <ul>
      <li>Lighting, tyres and brakes</li>
      <li>Chain and gears</li>
      <li>Battery.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Predictability</h2>

      <p>A predictable vehicle will warn when a fail is going to happen. E.g.; a brittle fracture in the frame causes a sudden fall, while a ductile fracture in the same area often gives the time to brake and soften the consequences.
      The predictability is examined on</p>

      <ul>
      <li>The frame and the handlebars</li>
      <li>The pedal mechanism</li>
      <li>The electric motor and the battery.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Maintenance</h2>

      <p>The maintenance score compares the vehicle with an theoretical vehicle that needs maintenance every week, is very hard to maintain and has no standardised components. A high figure means easy to maintain. Following concepts are regarded</p>

      <ul>
      <li>The tyres and attachment of components</li>
      <li>Lubrication and regulation of brakes and gears</li>
      <li>Electric circuits</li>
      </ul>
