        <h2>Brake performance</h2>
        <p>For this parameter the brake force at the wheel is measured for different forces on the brake lever. Below a schematic representation of the test setup is given on the left. On the right the TGVelo test setup is shown.</p>

        <p>Based on experience with different brakes the force on the lever is varied from 40 N to 120 N in steps of 20 N. At each lever force level the test bench brakes for 3 seconds, three times with several seconds in between. The mean brake force at the wheel from these three brake actions is divided by the lever force in that step. This results in the brake coefficient.</p>
        <p>After testing several different times of brake systems we found the range for brake coefficients. A brake coefficient of one or lower means very poor brake performance. Brake coefficient of four or higher means an excellent brake performance. A score on 10 can be calculated as follows:</p>
        <p>score = bc / 3 * 10</p>
