	<h2>TGVelo project</h2>
		<p>The TGVelo project is conducted by 25 Flemish partners and funded by the Flemish Institute for Science and Technology (IWT). During 2 years, 2 FET have been researching the quality of electric bicycles for intensive use at the University of Leuven, Technology Campus Ghent. The finality of this project is a set of standards for the assessment of the quality of light vehicles. The system is developed for electric bicycles, but it might be used for any human-, electric- or hybrid  powered two-, three- or four wheeled vehicle lighter than 50kg empty curb weight.
		The standards are useful for designers, producers, sellers and customers. It eases the selling process and simplifies settlement of warranty claims.
		</p>
	<h2>TGVelo Label</h2>
		<p>The TGVelo quality system gives an extensive overview of the quality of a light vehicle intended for daily or intensive use. It might be summarized in a label that can be displayed in a store and attached to the vehicle. The form and languages of this label will be standardised.</p>
